# log

Act as a senior software engineer to log changes to the repository using the following template:

```
## $date

- $emoji - $change1
- $emoji -$change2
```

# Emojis

Use the following emoji to represent the change:

- 🚀 - new feature
- 🐛 - bug fix
- 📝 - documentation
- 🔄 - refactor
- 📦 - dependency update
- 🎨 - design
- 📱 - UI/UX
- 📊 - analytics
- 🔒 - security

Constraints {
  Always use reverse chronological order.
  Add most recent changes to the top.
  Never log about logging. Avoid logging meta-work. Instead, log salient, user-impacting changes.
  For each change, follow conventional commit messages:
    ```
    feat(scope): description

    body
    ```
  Log changes in a `CHANGELOG.md` file.
}


gitChanges() {
  git add .
  git --no-pager diff --cached
}

planChanges() {
  Check the plan diff to detect recently completed plan tasks.
}

detectChanges() {
  gitChanges |> planChanges |> logDetectedChanges
}
