When you hire developers you're basically only screening for two things: Soft skills and hard skills.

Everything you're looking for can be grouped into these two categories:

1. Soft skills includes thinking for yourself, expressing yourself cleary, and fitting into your company culture.
2. Hard skills means does the devoloper know the technologies you need?

In this video, you're going to learn how you need to design your hiring process to filter for a-player developers that get you your desired outcome on a consistent basis.

I'm Jan, and I've interviewed hundreds of developers during my time at Hopin which grew from 7 to over 1000 employees. And now at ReactSquad, I've hired 15 devs just in the last 6 months.

So, I'm going to share with you the 6-step process that builds on top of all the hard-earned lessons I needed to learn so you can stop blowing money sitting in interviews and spending time fixing things that your bad hires screwed up.

### 1. CV

The first step, which is quite obvious, is reviewing the candidate's CV.

This allows you to do a quic screen to check if they know the frameworks, languages, and technologies used at your company.

One thing that I see many companies fail to do here, is they 
- It's important in this step to eliminate bias. You want it to be as merit basit as possible. 
  - You can let your HR team know, they should specifically ask people to include things, like their GitHub profile, so you can see their coding style. And you can also ask them to avoid candidates including their gender, race etc.
