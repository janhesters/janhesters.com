So, I recently released the first videos on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@janhesters) of a series about Redux.

When I talked to my mentees, many of them struggled to get their actions right.

I want to record this bonus micro-lesson for you to lay out the best practices for actions in detail.

Before we jump into it, if you haven't watched part one, ["What Is Redux? (Get A Senior Understanding Of How Redux Works)"](https://janhesters.com/blog/what-is-redux-get-a-senior-understanding-of-how-redux-works) and part two, ["Redux Saga Is Hard Until You Look Under The Hood"](https://janhesters.com/blog/redux-saga-is-hard-until-you-look-under-the-hood), pause this video now and watch them first. Then come back. This video assumes you know Redux's six building blocks and the basics of Redux Saga.

As a quick recap, Redux actions are objects with a `type` and an optional `payload`.

```js
const loginClicked = {
  type: 'LOGIN_CLICKED',
  payload: { email: 'jan@reactsquad.io', password: '5ub5cr1b3' },
};
```

These actions usually come from action creators, which are functions that return action objects.

```js
const loginClicked = (email, password) => ({
  type: 'LOGIN_CLICKED',
  payload: { email, password },
});
```

### Descriptive Names

The first best pratice is that actions should have descriptive names. These names should describe what happened in the app, instead of what the action does. This helps when debugging. Most people name their actions after what the action does, which makes it hard to understand what they do in the context of your app.

I want to give you a real example that came up with one of my mentees. He wanted to practice what he learned in the Redux videos and built a typing trainer game. In that game, the user types in certain strings that contain a lot of special characters. For each keystroke, the game checks if the user typed the correct characters, and if he got all right, it saves the level.

---

**Note to Cheta:** Record a few rounds / levels of the typing game, so we can show the footage here. Here is the link: [Symbol Trainer Redux](https://leonwarscheck.com/symbol-trainer-redux)

---

In the beginning, he designed his state with a single `setInputString` action.

```js title="src/features/type-trainer/type-trainer-reducer.js"
export const setInputString = payload => ({ type: 'SET_INPUT_STRING', payload });

export const sliceName = 'typeTrainer';

const initialState = {
  inputString: '',
  levelString: '{}/^%*#!)@(',
};

export const reducer = (state = initialState, { type, payload } = {}) => {
  switch (type) {
    case setInputString().type: {
      return { ...state, inputString: payload };
    }
    default: {
      return state;
    }
  }
};

export const selectTypeTrainerSlice = state => state[sliceName];

export const selectInputString = state =>
  selectTypeTrainerSlice(state).inputString;

export const selectLevelString = state =>
  selectTypeTrainerSlice(state).levelString;
```

He created a `setInputString` action that would be dispatched whenever the user typed in the input field.  

The state contained the current input string and the level string. The level string was the string for each level that the user had to type correctly.

In the reducer, he would update the state with the new input string.

Furthermore, he had selectors to read the current input string and the level string.

This state is highly simplified because I only want to illustrate the point of descriptive action names.  

Additionally, he had a saga that listened to all the changes of the input string and checked if the user typed the correct characters.

```js title="src/features/type-trainer/type-trainer-saga.js"
import { put, takeLeading } from 'redux-saga/effects';

import {
  selectInputString,
  selectLevelString,
  setInputString,
} from './type-trainer-reducer';

export function* handleInputString() {
  const inputString = yield select(selectInputString);
  const levelString = yield select(selectLevelString);

  if (inputString === levelString) {
    // Perform side effects like showing confetti or recording CPM.
    // Example: yield put(showConfetti);
    // Example: yield call(recordCharactersPerMinute);

    // Reset the input string.
    yield put(setInputString(''));
  }
}

export function* watchInputString() {
  yield takeLeading(setInputString.type, handleSetInputString);
}
```

The saga would listen to all the changes of the input string and check if the user typed the correct characters. If the user typed the correct characters, he used the `setInputString` action in the saga to reset the input string. In the real world, the action was even used a third time to reset the input when the user made a mistake.  

Now, here is how this example illustrates the problem with non-descriptive action names.  

If there is a bug in the code, it is hard to trace where the bug came from. By extension, the sagas are also hard to put into context. Currently, it looks like these sagas should run whenever the input string changes, even when triggered by themselves, e.g., during the reset.

---

**Note to editors:** really highlight the recursive nature here, that `setInputString` is triggering itself.

---

To fix this issue, you should give the action a descriptive name that explains what just happened, rather than what the action does.

---

**Note to Cheta:** As always, show the full file and change the things that changed here, even though a short circuit the example here with comments.

---

```js title="src/features/type-trainer/type-trainer-reducer.js" {1-2, 13, 16-18}
export const userTyped = payload => ({ type: 'USER_TYPED', payload });
export const userSucceeded = () => ({ type: 'USER_SUCCEEDED' });

export const sliceName = 'typeTrainer';

const initialState = {
  inputString: '',
  levelString: '{}/^%*#!)@(',
};

export const reducer = (state = initialState, { type, payload } = {}) => {
  switch (type) {
    case userTyped().type: {
      return { ...state, inputString: payload };
    }
    case userSucceeded().type: {
      return { ...state, levelString: '' };
    }
    default: {
      return state;
    }
  }
};

// ... selectors
```

Now the action `userTyped` describes what happened. And you add a second action `userSucceeded` to describe what happened when the user got typed the correct characters.

You can now use them in your saga.

```js title="src/features/type-trainer/type-trainer-saga.js" {6-7, 10, 20, 24-25}
import { put, takeLeading } from 'redux-saga/effects';

import {
  selectInputString,
  selectLevelString,
  userSucceeded,
  userTyped,
} from './type-trainer-reducer';

export function* handleUserTyped() {
  const inputString = yield select(selectInputString);
  const levelString = yield select(selectLevelString);

  if (inputString === levelString) {
    // Perform side effects like showing confetti or recording CPM.
    // Example: yield put(showConfetti);
    // Example: yield call(recordCharactersPerMinute);

    // Reset the input string.
    yield put(userSucceeded());
  }
}

export function* watchUserTyped() {
  yield takeLeading(userTyped.type, handleUserTyped);
}
```

Now you can see that the saga only listens to the `userTyped` action. When the user types the correct characters, the `userSucceeded` action is dispatched. This makes it clear what the saga is doing in the context of the app's functionality, rather than just in the context of what the action does programmatically.  

### Named Parameters  

Some action creators take multiple values in their payload.

```js title="login.js"
const loginClicked = (email, password) => ({
  type: 'LOGIN_CLICKED',
  payload: { email, password },
});
```

You can make action creators easier to read by using named parameters.

If you've never heard of named parameters, they allow you to specify function arguments by explicitly naming each parameter and assigning it a value when calling the function. This makes it clear which value corresponds to which parameter and allows arguments to be provided in any order.  

Technically, JavaScript doesn't support named parameters, so here is an example in Python, which does support named parameters.  

```py title="login.py"
def login(email, password):
    # TODO: Implement the login functionality
    pass

login(email="user@example.com", password="securepassword123")
```  

As mentioned above, you can call the function with the parameters in any order. So, both of these calls are equivalent:  

```py title="login.py"
login(email="user@example.com", password="securepassword123")
login(password="securepassword123", email="user@example.com")
```

In JavaScript, you can emulate named parameters by using an object as the parameter.

```js title="login.js" {1}
const loginClicked = ({ email, password }) => ({
  type: 'LOGIN_CLICKED',
  payload: { email, password },
});
```

When you now use the action, you are forced to name the arguments explicitly.

```js title="login.js"
loginClicked({ email: 'jan@reactsquad.io', password: '5ub5cr1b3' });
```

This makes it obvious what each argument means.

### Default Values

Using named parameters via an object is also a good way to set default values for the action.

```js title="login.js"
const saveProfileAvatarImage = ({ image, alt = 'Your profile avatar' }) => ({
  type: 'SAVE_PROFILE_AVATAR_IMAGE',
  payload: { image, alt },
});
```

In this example, the `alt` parameter is optional. If you don't provide it, it will default to 'Your profile avatar'. This also gives you type inference for the action and your editor knows that the `alt` property should be a string.

### Data Transformations

Action creators can transform data. For example, if you receive a date object that isn't serializable, you can convert it to a string.

```js title="saveDate.js"
const saveDate = date => ({
  type: 'SAVE_DATE',
  payload: date.toISOString(),
});
```

**As long as the action creator remains a pure function**, you can freely perform data transformations and even use array methods like `.map()`, `.filter()`, `.reduce()`, and others. This is obviously also true for the action handlers in your reducer's cases. And usually you do the complex transformations in those handlers. But I wanted to point out that in theory, you can also do pure data transformations in the action creator.

### Named Properties On Payloads

In this previous example, you saw that the action creator returns the date directly as the payload. Therefore, when you debug your Redux app, you only see that there is a date string on the object, but you don't know what it means.

```
action SAVE_DATE @ 12:34:56.789
  prev state  { ...previousState }
  action      { 
    type: 'SAVE_DATE', 
    payload: '2024-12-14T00:00:00.000Z' 
  }
  next state  { ...nextState }
```

You can make it possible for people to understand what the date means, by giving the payload a named property.

```js title="saveDate.js"
const saveDate = date => ({
  type: 'SAVE_DATE',
  payload: { currentBackupDate: date.toISOString() },
});
```

When you log out the action, you see that the payload contains a `currentBackupDate` property.

```
action SAVE_DATE @ 12:34:56.789
  prev state  { ...previousState }
  action      { 
    type: 'SAVE_DATE', 
    payload: { currentBackupDate: '2024-12-14T00:00:00.000Z' }
  }
  next state  { ...nextState }
```

This lets your coworkers, or your future self now, that the date of the payload is the date when the backup was created.

You can combine this with named properties, to make your action even more expressive.

```js title="saveDate.js"
const saveDate = ({ currentBackupDate }) => ({
  type: 'SAVE_DATE',
  payload: { currentBackupDate: currentBackupDate.toISOString() },
});
```

While this doesn't change the logging output, it makes it easier to understand what the arguments mean when you see the action in your code.

### Actions Can Have Multiple Effects

Another mentee of mine created a login flow in Redux. It consisted of four actions: `loginClicked`, `userFetched`, `showToast` and `finishLogin`. He set loading when login started, set the user when fetched, and finished the login when done. He also showed a toast.

He had a reducer that would handle the login state and the user profile.

```js title="src/features/user-authentication/user-authentication-reducer.js"
export const loginClicked = ({ email, password }) => ({
  type: 'LOGIN_CLICKED',
  payload: { email, password },
});
export const userFetched = () => ({ type: 'USER_FETCHED' });
export const finishLogin = () => ({ type: 'FINISH_LOGIN' });

const initialState = {
  email: '',
  password: '',
  isLoading: false,
  user: null,
};

export const reducer = (state = initialState, { type, payload } = {}) => {
  switch (type) {
    case loginClicked().type: {
      return { ...state, isLoading: true };
    }
    case userFetched().type: {
      return { ...state, user: payload };
    }
    case finishLogin().type: {
      return { ...state, isLoading: false };
    }
    default: {
      return state;
    }
  }
};
```

This reducer was responsible for three actions: `loginClicked`, `userFetched` and `finishLogin`.

When the login was clicked, he would set the loading state to `true`. When the user was fetched, he would set the user profile. And when the login was finished, he would set the loading state to `false`.

He also had a toast reducer that would show a toast message, for example when the login was successful.

```js title="src/features/toast/toast-reducer.js"
export const showToast = message => ({ type: 'SHOW_TOAST', payload: message });

const initialState = {
  message: '',
};

export const reducer = (state = initialState, { type, payload } = {}) => {
  switch (type) {
    case showToast().type: {
      return { ...state, message: payload };
    }
    default: {
      return state;
    }
  }
};
```

Again, I'm simplifying the code in all of these examples to illustrate the point.

He would use all of these actions in his saga.

```js title="src/features/user-authentication/user-authentication-saga.js"
import { call, put, takeLeading } from 'redux-saga/effects';

import { showToast } from './toast-reducer';
import { login } from './user-authentication-api';
import {
  finishLogin,
  loginClicked,
  userFetched,
} from './user-authentication-reducer';

function* handleLoginClicked({ payload: { email, password } }) {
  const user = yield call(login, email, password);
  yield put(userFetched(user));
  yield put(finishLogin());
  yield put(showToast('Login successful'));
}

export function* watchLoginClicked() {
  yield takeLeading(loginClicked().type, handleLoginClicked);
}
```

If you paid attention, you see that he already does many things right. He named a few actions descriptively, which also caused the sagas to have good names. And he was already using the same actions in multiple places: The `loginClicked` action both modified the state and started the `handleLoginClicked` saga. However, he structured his code in a way that forced him to dispatch too many actions. 

When the login succeeds, all that really happens is that the login is successful. There is no need to design the consequences so granularly.  

He fixed it by creating a single action, `loginSucceeded`, which is dispatched when the login is successful.

```js title="src/features/user-authentication/user-authentication-reducer.js" {5-8, 22-23}
export const loginClicked = ({ email, password }) => ({
  type: 'LOGIN_CLICKED',
  payload: { email, password },
});
export const loginSucceeded = user => ({
  type: 'LOGIN_SUCCEEDED',
  payload: { user },
});

const initialState = {
  email: '',
  password: '',
  isLoading: false,
  user: null,
};

export const reducer = (state = initialState, { type, payload } = {}) => {
  switch (type) {
    case loginClicked().type: {
      return { ...state, isLoading: true };
    }
    case loginSucceeded().type: {
      return { ...state, isLoading: false, user: payload.user };
    }
    default: {
      return state;
    }
  }
};
```

Notice how he designed the `loginSucceeded` action to take the user as an argument but still included it in the payload as a key-value pair in an object. This approach makes it easier to see what the payload contains when using logging middleware or Redux DevTools.  

Now, you can use the action in the saga to consolidate two dispatch calls into one.

```js title="src/features/user-authentication/user-authentication-saga.js" {10-11}
import { call, put, takeLeading } from 'redux-saga/effects';

import { showToast } from './toast-reducer';
import { login } from './user-authentication-api';
import { loginClicked, loginSucceeded } from './user-authentication-reducer';

function* handleLoginClicked({ payload: { email, password } }) {
  const user = yield call(login, email, password);
  yield put(loginSucceeded(user));
  yield put(showToast('Login successful'));
}

export function* watchLoginClicked() {
  yield takeLeading(loginClicked().type, handleLoginClicked);
}
```

### Multiple Reducers Can Handle The Same Action

You might have noticed that there is still a seperate action `showToast` being dispatched in the saga.

Another important best practice for actions is that it is okay to let multiple reducers handle the same action. Instead of dispatching `showToast`, let the toast reducer also respond to `loginSucceeded`:

```js title="src/features/toast/toast-reducer.js" {1, 14-16}
import { loginSucceeded } from './user-authentication-reducer';

export const showToast = message => ({ type: 'SHOW_TOAST', payload: message });

const initialState = {
  message: '',
};

export const reducer = (state = initialState, { type, payload } = {}) => {
  switch (type) {
    case showToast().type: {
      return { ...state, message: payload };
    }
    case loginSucceeded().type: {
      return { ...state, message: 'Login successful' };
    }
    default: {
      return state;
    }
  }
};
```

You import the `loginSucceeded` action from the `user-authentication-reducer.js` and also create a case for it in the `toast-reducer.js`.

The handler for the `loginSucceeded` action ignores the `payload`. You also don't need to pass a message as the payload because, when the login succeeds, the toast message is always the same.

Now you can remove the `showToast` action from the saga.

```js title="src/features/user-authentication/user-authentication-saga.js"
import { call, put, takeLeading } from 'redux-saga/effects';

import { login } from './user-authentication-api';
import { loginClicked, loginSucceeded } from './user-authentication-reducer';

function* handleLoginClicked({ payload: { email, password } }) {
  const user = yield call(login, email, password);
  yield put(loginSucceeded(user));
}

export function* watchLoginClicked() {
  yield takeLeading(loginClicked().type, handleLoginClicked);
}
```

### Dispatching The Same Action In Multiple Places

When we refactored his code like this during a mentoring session, the mentee asked:  

> “What if the `loginSucceeded` action is used in multiple places? For example, if there are different sagas for different login strategies (e.g., Google, email/password, etc.)?”  

The answer is that if the reducers' behavior should be the same, you can use the same action. If they are different, you should use distinct actions that describe exactly what happened differently. Instead of `loginSucceeded`, you could have `loginSucceededWithGoogle` and `loginSucceededWithEmailPassword`, and so on. This ties back to the first point about using descriptive action names. You will see code for this in the next section.

In conclusion, one action can either be dispatched in multiple sagas or on clicks in different places in your app. And this one action can be handled in the case of different reducers and simultaneously trigger different sagas.

### Multiple Actions Causing The Same State Update (With State Update Helpers)

Going back to the example from above with different login strategies, assume that there is an email and a Google login strategy. Both should cause the same user authentication state updates (flip the boolean, set the user), but they should show different toast messages.

Here is how the reducer looks like:

---

**Note to Cheta:** Please pay careful attention and show the exact changes as compared to the previous iteration with just one login strategy.

---

```js title="src/features/user-authentication/user-authentication-reducer.js"
export const loginWithEmailClicked = ({ email, password }) => ({
  type: 'LOGIN_WITH_EMAIL_CLICKED',
  payload: { email, password },
});
export const loginWithGoogleClicked = () => ({
  type: 'LOGIN_WITH_GOOGLE_CLICKED',
});
export const loginSucceededWithEmail = user => ({
  type: 'LOGIN_SUCCEEDED_WITH_EMAIL',
  payload: { user },
});
export const loginSucceededWithGoogle = user => ({
  type: 'LOGIN_SUCCEEDED_WITH_GOOGLE',
  payload: { user },
});

const initialState = {
  email: '',
  password: '',
  isLoading: false,
  user: null,
};

const startAuthentication = state => ({ ...state, isLoading: true });

const loginSucceeded = (state, { user }) => ({
  ...state,
  isLoading: false,
  user,
});

export const reducer = (state = initialState, { type, payload } = {}) => {
  switch (type) {
    case loginWithEmailClicked().type: {
      return startAuthentication(state);
    }
    case loginWithGoogleClicked().type: {
      return startAuthentication(state);
    }
    case loginSucceededWithEmail().type: {
      return loginSucceeded(state, payload);
    }
    case loginSucceededWithGoogle().type: {
      return loginSucceeded(state, payload);
    }
    default: {
      return state;
    }
  }
};
```

There are two different actions depending on what strategy the user clicked. And there are also two actions that are dispatched when either of the login strategies is successful.

Since they cause the same state update, their state updates can be abstracted away into state update helper functions that then get used in the respective cases.

Here is how the sagas would use these actions.

```js title="src/features/user-authentication/user-authentication-saga.js"
import { call, put, takeLeading } from 'redux-saga/effects';

import { loginWithEmail, loginWithGoogle } from './user-authentication-api';
import {
  loginSucceededWithEmail,
  loginSucceededWithGoogle,
  loginWithEmailClicked,
  loginWithGoogleClicked,
} from './user-authentication-reducer';

/*
Email login
*/

function* handleLoginWithEmailClicked({ payload: { email, password } }) {
  const user = yield call(loginWithEmail, email, password);
  yield put(loginSucceededWithEmail(user));
}

export function* watchLoginWithEmailClicked() {
  yield takeLeading(loginWithEmailClicked().type, handleLoginWithEmailClicked);
}

/*
Google login
*/

function* handleLoginWithGoogleClicked() {
  const user = yield call(loginWithGoogle);
  yield put(loginSucceededWithGoogle(user));
}

export function* watchLoginWithGoogleClicked() {
  yield takeLeading(
    loginWithGoogleClicked().type,
    handleLoginWithGoogleClicked,
  );
}
```

You create two sagas that listen to the respective actions and dispatch the respective login succeeded actions.

You need to add a case to the toast reducer for each of these strategies because they should show different toast messages.

```js title="src/features/toast/toast-reducer.js"
import {
  loginSucceededWithEmail,
  loginSucceededWithGoogle,
} from './user-authentication-reducer';

export const showToast = message => ({ type: 'SHOW_TOAST', payload: message });

const initialState = {
  message: '',
};

export const reducer = (state = initialState, { type, payload } = {}) => {
  switch (type) {
    case showToast().type: {
      return { ...state, message: payload };
    }
    case loginSucceededWithEmail().type: {
      return { ...state, message: 'Email login successful' };
    }
    case loginSucceededWithGoogle().type: {
      return { ...state, message: 'Google login successful' };
    }
    default: {
      return state;
    }
  }
};
```

In this example, you saw that the `loginWithEmailClicked` and `loginWithGoogleClicked` actions cause the same state update. And the `loginSucceededWithEmail` and `loginSucceededWithGoogle` actions cause the same state update in one reducer, but different state updates in another reducer.

### Attaching `type` as a Static Property  

The last point that confused people was encountering actions with a static `type` property, used like this:  

```js title="static-type-property.js"
const reducer = (state = initialState, { type, payload } = {}) => {
  switch (type) {
    case someAction.type: {
      // Handle action
    }
  }
};

function* watchSomeAction() {
  yield takeEvery(someAction.type, handleSomeAction);
}
```  

This pattern sometimes appears, especially with Redux Toolkit's `createAction`, which your learn in the third video of this series.  

When creating actions manually, some developers like to attach the `type` as a static property to the action:  

```js title="static-type-property.js"
const someAction = payload => ({ type: someAction.type, payload });
someAction.type = 'SOME_ACTION';

const reducer = (state = initialState, { type, payload } = {}) => {
  switch (type) {
    case someAction.type: {
      return { ...state, message: payload };
    }
    // ...
  }
};

function* watchSomeAction() {
  yield takeEvery(someAction.type, handleSomeAction);
}
```

This avoids creating unnecessary action objects when calling the action to determine the type for the case or when hooking up sagas.

But if you have actions with transformations that require data, you can't call them without arguments, like we did it above in cases and when hooking up sagas.

```js title="static-type-property-required.js"
const explodeWithoutArgs = data => ({
  type: explodeWithoutArgs.type,
  payload: data.toUpperCase(), // This will throw if data is undefined
});
explodeWithoutArgs.type = 'EXPLODE_WITHOUT_ARGS';

const reducer = (state = initialState, { type, payload } = {}) => {
  switch (type) {
    case explodeWithoutArgs.type: {
      return { ...state, message: payload };
    }
    case explodeWithoutArgs().type: { // This would crash ❌
      return { ...state, message: payload };
    }
    // ...
  }
};
```

Of course, you can avoid this, if you instead transform the data in the respective cases action handler instead.

This difference is small and stylistic. It comes down to preference.
