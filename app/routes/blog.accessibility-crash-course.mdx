- **Never use outdated presentational tags** like `<big>` and `<font>`; they are deprecated. 
- Some tags, like `<i>` and `<b>`, now have semantic purposes.
- **Favor structural elements** like `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<header>`, `<nav>`, and `<footer>` where applicable. These improve accessibility and provide clear meaning to your content. `<div>` is a common choice for block-level containers, but lacks semantic meaning.
- **Use heading levels logically.** Don’t skip levels or choose them just to get a specific font size—that’s what CSS is for.
- **Logical headings also improve SEO.** Keywords in headings get a boost in search rankings.
- **Accessibility benefits:** Assistive technologies like screen readers rely on headings and landmarks to navigate content. Without proper headings, HTML documents become hard to use for AT users.
- **Ensure HTML is correctly nested.** If it’s not, browsers will guess your structure, and the result may differ from your intent.
- **Validate your markup using tools** like the HTML validator. In Firefox, for example, you can view source to spot validation errors, highlighted with a dotted red underline.
