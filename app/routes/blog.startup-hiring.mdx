Companies should have two recurring meetings at most:
A weekly all-hands and a weekly exec team meeting, which is essentially a startup-in-a-startup for the CEO. Both of these meetings should be fundamentally motivational and focused on knowledge creation.
Functional meetings are the worst. If a designer wants advice from another designer, they should get up and go talk to them.
Functional meetings can’t make any decisions since the other functions aren’t in the room. Even worse, most problems are cross-functional and creative solutions are almost always cross-functional.


If you ask recruits the same interview questions as everybody else, you have no filter, you have no advantage and you have no ideas!

What matters at a startup, in order of importance:
1. Recruiting
2. Product
3. Marketing
4. Sales
-∞. Planning, Meetings, HR, etc.
Do any item on this list well, and the next one is “easy”.

The ideal recruit for any role is:
- Technical
- An artist
- Constantly generating new knowledge
- Using AI to automate the repetitive parts of their job
Exceptions apply.

We’re hiring an Editor for the Naval podcast (http://nav.al), the most timeless, overproduced podcast in human history.
You will primarily edit the podcast in Descript, edit the transcripts for clarity, and post videos to social media to get Naval’s ideas into the hands of 8 billion people.
If you’re already working on another podcast, don’t hesitate to contact us. You’ll learn more with us. If you’re more of a producer, feel free to get in touch—we are open to new ideas.
This is a part-time role but there’s infinite room to get into more challenging and creative problems. You don’t need experience, but you need to be extremely smart and high-slope.
- You must have DSM-5-level attention to detail
- You must be a good writer and have a nose for design
- You must ‘get it’ the first time you hear it
Please send < 750 characters about yourself to podcast@nav.al. Include links to your best work and your smartest tweet. Tell us about a hard problem you’ve solved, new knowledge you’re creating for fun, and share something you’ve made with AI. The shorter, the better.
Thanks for considering us.
