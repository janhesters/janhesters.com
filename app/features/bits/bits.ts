The right one is:

Everything else will follow.

Make your code do what you want & you will naturally learn TDD, FP etc.`,

‚úÖ <b>Good developer:</b>

‚Ä¢ <b>High-agency</b> - Apply specific knowledge, leverage, and accountability, so that you solve problems intelligently. You resolve issues alone or with teammates without needing constant guidance.
‚Ä¢ <b>Hungry learner</b> - Your learning trajectory is steep, so you can keep up with the ever evolving programming landscape.
‚Ä¢ <b>Humble</b> - You are willing to learn from others and have their opinions challenged.
‚Ä¢ <b>Confident</b> - Believe in yourself.
‚Ä¢ <b>Flexible</b> - You are able to adapt to different situations quickly.
‚Ä¢ <b>Mentorship</b> - Actively help junior developers improve their skills.
‚Ä¢ <b>Deep expertise in current tech stack</b> - Work with and contribute to your team's current software stack.
‚Ä¢ <b>Good communicator</b> - Give clear updates to non-technical stakeholders and be able to collaborate in groups and document software clearly.
‚Ä¢ <b>Detail oriented</b> - Consider happy & sad paths and find edge cases.
‚Ä¢ <b>Big-picture thinking</b> - Apply systems-thinking to see how various pieces fit together and interact in the overall structure of the software.
‚Ä¢ <b>High empathy</b> - Understand your teammates, users, and the company.

‚ùå <b>Bad Developer:</b>

‚Ä¢ <b>Lazy</b> - Has low accountability and avoids responsibility and blames others for failures.
‚Ä¢ <b>Resistant to feedback</b> - Neither accepts nor acts on constructive criticism.
‚Ä¢ <b>Braggadocious</b> - Compensates by overhyping their contributions and undermining others.
‚Ä¢ <b>Imposter syndrome</b> - Belittles themselves as an excuse to stay in a negative state.
‚Ä¢ <b>Rigid</b> - Struggles to adjust to changes in priorities or technologies.
‚Ä¢ <b>Unapproachable</b> - Dismisses junior developers and refuses to support their growth.
‚Ä¢ <b>Surface-level coding</b> - Works quickly or overengineers to produce buggy, unmaintainable code.
‚Ä¢ <b>Poor communication</b> - Fails to update stakeholders or explain their work clearly.
‚Ä¢ <b>Neglects attention to detail</b> - Misses bugs, designs or edge cases, causing frequent problems and incorrectly implements requirements.
‚Ä¢ <b>Tunnel vision</b> - Lacks awareness of how their work fits into the larger project or system.
‚Ä¢ <b>Disruptive attitude</b> - Negatively impacts team morale by being uncooperative or entitled.

Contrary to what most believe, these soft skills & attributes are often way more important than just raw knowledge about a tech stack.`,
