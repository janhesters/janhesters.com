About 1000 developers had a fantastic push to their careers in 2020. I'm talking about the top 5% of people who know WebRTC. If you search for developers that know WebRTC on LinkedIn today, you get 23.000 results.

I felt overwhelmed when I first learned about WebRTC. This article reveals how we use WebRTC at Hopin and StreamYard using simple explanations.

## What is WebRTC?

WebRTC (Web Real Time Communication) is a technology within browsers. Google invented it and open-sourced it in 2011. Websites and apps can use WebRTC to communicate via audio und video.

Companies embracing remote more has sky-rocketed the demand for video-based products. And these video features are built with WebRTC.

There are three widespread architectures for WebRTC applications: Mesh, Routing and Mixing - more on that later.

## Why WebRTC?

WebRTC is easy (compared to existing alternatives) to onboard for companies and their users that want to have real-time communication.

- **WebRTC is free** - As open source with a BSD license, everyone can use it. There are also almost no patents for the codecs involved.
- **JavaScript API** - Accessible for web developers, instead of having to learn VoIP. Web developers are also cheaper than media engineers.
- **(Almost) no friction for users** - WebRTC comes with every modern browser, so users won't need to download and install any software, app or plugin.
- **Mature** - WebRTC has been around since 2011 and has a large ecosystem. WebRTC has some privacy and encryption features built it. Keep an eye out for the official WebRTC 1.0 release.

## Browser Compatabilities

At Hopin we recommend our clients to use Chrome (or Firefox) because they work best with WebRTC.

- **Internet Explorer** doesn’t support WebRTC at all because it is deprecated and hasn’t been updated since WebRTC went mainstream.
- The **Chrome** and **Firefox** teams update their browsers every 4 to 6 weeks and make sure the (constantly evolving and changing) WebRTC specification is implemented correctly and works well.
- The newer versions of **Edge**, which are based on Chromium should also work well with WebRTC. Older versions of Edge, tend to work badly.
- **Safari**’s update cycle is slow. Apple only updates the browser every 6 months and Apple tends to do their own thing and sometimes implement WebRTC differently than the current specification creating critical edge cases that can break apps.

If you're a developer, make sure you use the [WebRTC adapter](https://github.com/webrtchacks/adapter) to enable the latest WebRTC APIs across most browsers and versions. It is a polyfill that abstracts away differences such as prefixes and lets you write spec compliant code.

## Who Uses WebRTC?

Since Google created WebRTC after acquiring On2, GIPS and MPEG-LA, they use it for their products such as Meet and Hangouts. Facebook uses WebRTC in their Messenger's and Instagram's video calls. Zoom uses WebRTC for their `DataChannel`. And we at Hopin and [StreamYard](https://streamyard.com) power our sessions, networking, and broadcasting studio with WebRTC.

## Mesh

## Routing

## Mixing

Hopin and StreamYard continue their hypergrowth. If you're interested, join us and apply for a [job at Hopin](https://hopin.com/careers) or StreamYard. As a programmer, you don't need to know WebRTC for most positions. We're looking for folx who know JavaScript and React, Ruby or Rust.
